I find myself appreciating the transformation of a known space and the clean, minimal look of the set. Niki and Jorge Cousineau, who are very much at home with each other and on the stage, open the piece by reciting years and gesturing with their hands to “describe” them. “1996” she says as Jorge draws a small line in space in front of his chest; “1998” says he and Niki jumps and rubs her legs vigorously with her palms. There is a simplicity to the vocabulary, and a sweetness. He takes a wrapped candy out of his pocket for her; they often look at each other and smile. In a contrasting moment, Jorge curls up on the floor and she stands in the curve of his body, leaning out toward the audience. There is pressure between the bodies, they are off-kilter, like the akimbo pieces of architecture. This moment stands out because so often during the dance as a whole, bodies, objects and meaning were stacked almost too easily into their proper place. After the opening section, the set tumbles down. Niki shifts the pieces, which read as parts of a house (maybe the house they are building together) with her body as Jorge amplifies the accompanying sound through a computer upstage left. During this section, I begin to wonder about the role of the dancer in this piece. This line of questioning persists as Jorge brings out a clothesline, stringing out a long line of white shirts while Niki weaves around them and switches their places along the line. It is a strong image, and would photograph beautifully, but does not need the accompanying dance. Dance’s rather persistent quality of taking up space and time kept pointing itself out and in this instance, because Niki “stayed at home with the dance” as Jorge stepped out to work with technological elements, the dance was feminine. Soon after, Jorge gives a pretend TED talk, complete with basic scientific facts about memory, suggesting that the intellectual content is male.The years go on into the 2000s and other dancers enter the stage to recreate some of Subcircle’s earlier works. The performers, Christy Lee, Christina Zani and Scott McPheeters, are mature, serene and appear to be members of a supportive community. Beau Hancock appears on video only (first on a scrim and later in a duet with Niki projected on new stacks of the set in the center of the stage). His role is not explained, which is unfortunate because rather than an extension of Jorge in the rather romantic duet (which I am assuming is the intended reading), he is like an interloping stranger. In the sections following, the dancers politely take turns. Nothing is ever too loud or harsh, or takes too much effort. There are hints of conflict, disaster even—the house flies apart with a thunderous crash—but the performers seem unscathed. They continue to bend lithely, sweep their legs in small arcs and lightly touch each other or smile and embrace. Coming out of this cozy warmth comes another striking image, Niki and Jorge trace live feed projections of each other’s bodies with pen onto a tiny foam core house and then wash the lines away with water from a tiny glass. Beautiful, but a bit out of left field, I experience this moment as a nod to erasure and dance’s other persistent habit of disappearance. I went into the performance knowing that the piece was to be about Niki and Jorge Cousineau’s relationship and I left the performance not knowing much more about it. I can, however, imagine them holding hands sweetly for decades to come. “2034… 2048” they say, and the dance goes on."}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"}],"author":"Eleanor Goudie-Averill","title":"Making Nice, More or Less","_id":"30fdfe62-f741-4cc7-a66e-60000d30542f","heroImage":null}},{"node":{"_createdAt":"2019-07-30T23:57:00Z","_rawBody":[{"_key":"5acee44039b8","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"5acee44039b80","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"TD writers, polled for quick takes on Group Motion’s performance of "},{"_key":"5acee44039b81","_type":"span","marks":["em"],"text":"THEN"},{"_key":"5acee44039b82","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":" by Susan Rethorst, responded in ways that were warm, cool and in-between. “The biggest impression "},{"_key":"5acee44039b83","_type":"span","marks":["em"],"text":"THEN"},{"_key":"5acee44039b84","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":" left me with was how not-needy it was.

Lindsay Browning’s impish and dramatic facial posturing and gestures were very similar to what Susan asked us to do during an audition for her work in 2012. In 208 East Broadway Michelle Stortz also performed a sequence like this…moving from upstage to downstage while batting eyelashes and flirting with the audience, or an invisible presence. Many other details too, like the particular way that dancers touched, poked, or manipulated each other’s bodies (stepping over each other while kicking limbs out of the way) were reminiscent of bodies of material that we cultivated during our rehearsal process. Even one exact movement sequence, with a port de bras of the arms high overhead and then some twitching thumbs, was quoted verbatim. Many artists reference, recycle, or quote verbatim** from their earlier work, and this practice probably contributes to the cultivation of their own particular aesthetic. I’m wondering, for Susan, how this practice relates to her commitment to “not knowing” in the studio.”**— Megan Bridge\n\n“I found during this show that my mind was wandering a lot, which surprised me. The friend I went with said she experienced the same. I also wonder if some of that wandering attention was due to this feeling I had that some of the work was like an inside joke that I wasn’t totally in on. Something about it was a little bit more alienating than inviting. And I had thoughts about whether I would feel that way were I not familiar with all of the dancers in the cast, which was an interesting thought proposal.” – Becca Weber\n\n“I think the way that Susan works with dancers is particularly flattering to a company like Group Motion. The company is full of powerhouse performers who are fully embodied and present both physically and facially. Susan’s choreography, in particular the relaxed precision that her movement contains, suits this group of dancers particularly well.” – Megan Bridge\n\n“I think the experience, too, shows the value of bringing in outside artists to be a source of continuing re-invigoration and discovery for an on-going and most talented company of dancers.” — Jonathan Stein\n\n"},{"_key":"5acee44039b811","_type":"span","marks":["em"],"text":"THEN"},{"_key":"5acee44039b812","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":", by Susan Rethorst and Group Motion, Arts Bank, January 16-19, 2014"}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"}],"author":"Megan Bridge","title":"Quick Takes- 'THEN'","_id":"aea54d78-8c74-4624-9cc0-2bb58f08cec7","heroImage":null}},{"node":{"_createdAt":"2019-07-30T23:56:16Z","_rawBody":[{"_key":"449a1fbc2477","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"449a1fbc24770","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"These days, there is as much a global arts scene as a global economy.

Her five dancers, in sheer black skirts and variations on black tank leotards, have the unfrilly look of Balanchine ballerinas, but with a physical variety Mr. B would not have accommodated. They are different in affect—the one more open and lush, the next more brittle. In all, they execute the motions of the dance rather than getting pulled in, never seeming to sink in too deep.

Some shapings of stage space stand out, as when one duo shares the space with another, on different movement pathways. When the movement becomes continuous, as opposed to shifting through poses, it has a waltz-like buoyancy. But set as it is to iconic Beethoven (the “Moonlight” Sonata), I’m surprised that the dance seems not to inhabit the music but rather dance on top of, or even in spite of it. It remains a mystery to me who composed the variations on the Beethoven. No program note credits either the person who played the piano, or who unhinged the original by electronically altering the sound with reverb or slowing. I wonder too: Why have poorly recorded music played so loud and so fast that it feels punishing (Beethoven as torment)? Why does lighting designer Clifford Greer choose to shine those cold quartz lights directly in the eyes of the audience in an intermittent, undecipherable pattern? Why cut nearly every movement segment before it has the chance to develop into something that feels complete? The one insight I came away with had to do with contrast. At times the action melts into satisfying slowness, the light shifts to incandescence, as when Gibson herself steps backward away from a dramatic spotlight to begin the final section. The light transforms from the cold and forbidding to the warm and settled. Perhaps the Morse code-like signals transmitted through the flashing of harsh quartz light, blasting Beethoven and tightly-held dance fragments were translatable into a cohesive whole that reflects on these contrasts. But it was challenging to glean even that much significance, and I’m not sure what about these contrasting states I was supposed to understand. What makes me unable to simply see the work as series of viable choices within an abstract form? Perhaps even more than narrative work, to my mind, abstract pieces need to indicate the world they are moving in, to reveal the workings of the choreographer’s choicemaking. When no patterns are evident, I hope to see some readable stance in regard to the use of the materials, perhaps even a determined non-patterning. If the work is disjunctive, I hope to be left with a quality of watching a parade of changing images that sit in some interesting relationship to each other. In this work, neither of these hopes was met. Of course people’s responses differ. The young boy in the audience who was there with his dancer mom told me he was excited about the piece. He loved its intensity and dramatic changes. That’s another way to see it."}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"},{"_key":"df884d6e3720","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"df884d6e37200","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"Philadelphia Dance Projects, presenter of the evening’s works, often pairs Philly artists with out-of-towners.

Departing from her work of the past decade, Canuso has created a well-designed solo movement theater work of personal memoir, challenging herself to vary the ways she calls up memories of her childhood. Before she appeared on stage, she used masking tape to create a variety of shapes on the ground, shapes we later learn are part of the floor plan of the house she grew up in. Canuso’s mix of reminiscences included some striking scenes. A rapid recitation of household items (dropped ceiling, toaster) was paired with a similarly paced tossing off of abbreviated gestures. When looking through an imagined window, she delivered a report of a street scene, rendered undecipherable by her frenetic excitement. Knowing Canuso’s movement potential, I await more physical embodiment of her stories, which might well occur in the full-length piece. Some elements of Midway Avenue seemed arbitrary as in an early repetition of phrases like “there’s a table,” or when she conjured a dead body in the house, connecting it to a lugubrious Chopin Prelude with an explanation of its premonition of death, followed by a remembrance of her own mother’s fear of her daughter’s death.
