At the center of Driscoll’s work is full force physical commitment laying bare the states and relationships evolving over and within the performers’ bodies, evolutions that manifest in nameable archetypes and then just as quickly dissolve and disappear from our view. Driscoll’s work presents a body housing multiple narratives, a human living out many relationships and identities. And she does all this without engaging with forced theatrics; instead identifications emerge from within, proving a permeable body being stretched by the bounds of her work itself. In this intermingling of “reality” and “imagination”, Driscoll’s work challenges the very notion of representation and explores how we construct identity and narrative, and how we simply exist next to another body."}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"},{"_key":"3e18820e15b4","_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-acb1a0dd8ea4681af4562889ce318a486c471b75-302x208-jpg","_type":"reference"}},{"_key":"71328f04d67d","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"71328f04d67d0","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"Driscoll exists in the vanguard of artistic inquiry around performance practice and associative identity.\nI consider Faye Driscoll a necessary and welcome voice in the contemporary performance community.\nWe are so happy to have her here."}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"},{"_key":"30799f854552","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"30799f8545520","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"[Meg Foley, independent choreographer/dancer, is founder of Moving Parts (movingpartsdance.org).\nHer next performance is March 28-31, 2012 at the "},{"_key":"30799f8545521","_type":"span","marks":["93c045fb891d"],"text":"Badass Fun Dance: a mini-festival"},{"_key":"30799f8545522","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":", at "},{"_key":"30799f8545523","_type":"span","marks":["71c3fe6606b6"],"text":"Harbourfront Centre"},{"_key":"30799f8545524","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":" Toronto, Ontario]"}],"markDefs":[{"_key":"93c045fb891d","_type":"link","href":"http://www.harbourfrontcentre.com/whatson/today.cfm?id=3296"},{"_key":"71c3fe6606b6","_type":"link","href":"http://www.harbourfrontcentre.com/"}],"style":"normal"}],"author":"Philadelphia Dance Projects","title":"PDP Presents 2012 - Two Printed Program Essays","_id":"71859e15-1924-427f-b6c0-301d57ee625f","heroImage":null}},{"node":{"_createdAt":"2019-07-30T23:33:10Z","_rawBody":[{"_key":"7be0593afcb5","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"7be0593afcb50","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"Sometimes when a critic sees a dance the first time, it goes over her head.
