Beginning with a radically open, movement-based mindfulness of her body and the surrounding environment, she induces a similar sense of presence in her dancers and collaborators to what is around them. Somehow, this expanded awareness makes its way into the audience. It may be, as Meredith Monk suggests, that even the surroundings are awakened in a new way. Anyone who has been to one of her performances has experienced this.
